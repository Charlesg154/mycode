PROJECT EXPECTATIONS:

    The program executes cleanly without error and meets its intended purpose.
    The program has been designed to accommodate human errors.
    The program is designed as efficiently as possible (do more with less!)
    The programâ€™s output is easy to read and is presented well (and free of spelling errors)
    
    Wherever possible, the program follows PEP 8 standards:
        Keep code inside of functions
        Indent consistently (4 spaces)
        title/purpose of script at top of document
        Comment your code well, and often!

"""
"""
The purpose of the project is to present RPG concepts.  User will control a character and need to
collect items and avoid game ending scenarios via clues presented.  One challenge I'd like to present
is reading and writing save data for the user to start and end the game when desired without losing
progress
